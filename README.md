# NBA Spread Predictor
Predicts NBA game spreads trained on 10 seasons of NBA data from 3 different data sources. This model is powered by combining time series data fed into Gated Recurrent Units and static data fed into a Multilayer Perceptron, rather than using Monte Carlo like industry sportsbooks. Predictions achieve mean squared error within 3% of industry sportsbooks.
